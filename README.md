## Abstract

Current dehazing methods for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images often hold problems of texture detail loss in highlight regions and color distortions. This is mainly due to incorrect estimation of the transmission. In this paper, we propose a UAV dehazing method based on saliency guided two-scale transmission correction. Firstly, we propose a dehaze-driven frequency domain saliency model to detect highlight regions of hazy UAV images for better transmission correction. Secondly, we introduce a two-scale correction method to estimate the transmission map with more accurate texture details. We also introduce a suppression parameter to further suppress color distortions and energy over-reduction. Finally, the saliency map is taken as a weight of transmission correction to avoid texture detail loss and color distortions, especially in highlights. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method shows better visual effect and detail visibility, especially for UAV images with highlight regions.
