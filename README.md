## Abstract

Current dehazing methods for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images often hold problems of texture detail loss in highlight regions and color distortions. This is mainly due to incorrect estimation of the transmission. In this paper, we propose a UAV dehazing method based on saliency guided two-scale transmission correction. Firstly, we propose a dehaze-driven frequency domain saliency model to detect highlight regions of hazy UAV images for better transmission correction. Secondly, we introduce a two-scale correction method to estimate the transmission map with more accurate texture details. We also introduce a suppression parameter to further suppress color distortions and energy over-reduction. Finally, the saliency map is taken as a weight of transmission correction to avoid texture detail loss and color distortions, especially in highlights. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method shows better visual effect and detail visibility, especially for UAV images with highlight regions.



## Describe your project

You are currently viewing your project's **README** file. **_README_** files are like cover pages or elevator pitches for your project. They are written in plain text or [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and usually include a paragraph describing the project, directions on how to use it, who authored it, and more.


## Citation

Want to edit the site you just published? Let’s practice commits by introducing yourself in your `index.html` file. Don’t worry about getting it right the first time—you can always build on your introduction later.

Let’s start with this template:

```
<p>Hello World! I’m [username]. This is my website!</p>
```

To add your introduction, copy our template and click the edit pencil icon at the top right hand corner of the `index.html` file.

Delete this placeholder line:

```
<p>Coming soon</p>
```

Then, paste the template to line 15 and fill in the blanks.
